# 1.3.6 (Pre-Alpha) - 2025-01-03

## BREAKING (Compiler Internals)
  - Sum types and internal/external choices now have their tag value determined by the `C_STYLE` internal representation of the type instead of the LLVM-IR string representation due to introduction of opaque pointers
  - Per upgrading LLVM, a new docker image has been introduced. For older builds, be sure to specify the v1.3.5 tag to continue development.
 
## Features
  - Added support for Nix via flakes
  - Improved documentation for getting started with and using Bismuth codebase

## Compiler Internals
  - Updated from LLVM-12 to LLVM-19
  - Updated from Clang-14 to Clang-19 (docker) or GCC (Nix)
  - Test cases now use files instead of hashes to make identifying changes easier

## Outstanding Issues
  - Due to minor differences between Clang and GCC, not all test cases pass on GCC  (see 0789b91)
  - Coverage is only supported via Docker image and clang; some instabilities with coverage appear to occasionally occur
