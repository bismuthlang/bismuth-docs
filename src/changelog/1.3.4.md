# 1.3.4 (Pre-Alpha) - 2024-05-03


## Features
  - Added ability to use labels for describing internal and external choice alternatives
  - Added dynamically sized arrays
  - Added `Cancelable<>` session type modality
  - Return statements can be omitted in functions that return `Unit`. 
  - Added Logical & Arithmetic Right Bit Shift, Left Bit Shift, Bit XOR/AND/OR
  - Added imports, basic name mangling, and generics/templates
  - Added `u32`, `i64`, and `u64` (`int` and `i32` are now interchangeable)
  - Added ability to specify integer values in hex via 0x and binary via 0b prefixes
  - Added for loops
  - Added `toChannel` function to convert `ty` -> `Channel<!+ty>` or `ty[]` -> `Channel<!+ty>` in the case of arrays
  - Added `--display-mode` CLI option to enable error messages to show types as they would appear in-code instead of mathematical representation
  - Now displaying number of errors on compile failure

## Bugs 
  - Fixed bug wherein `T_1 -> T_2[]` is ambiguous by allowing `(T_1 -> T_2)[]`
  - Improved syntax and handling of l-values to enable expressions like improved syntax to allow *(expr).<field> syntax, 
  - Fixed bug where nested control flow would incorrectly process use of linear resources
  - Fixed typos in generated IR files, error messages, and compiler internals

## Compiler Internals
  - Reorganized compiler internals to separate CLI elements and support generics
  - Refactored symbol/allocation handling by connecting them to FQNs instead of symbols
  - Reorganized compilation order to conduct codegen after all of semantic analysis
  - Removed CLI feature `-s` to supply input string instead of file location; makes more sense to re-add in future as REPL.
  - Added new error type for internal/compiler errors. 
  - Improved efficiency of IPC by removing state to eliminate additional lookup step
  - Refactored code internals to promote compile speed (of Bismuth, not the Bismuth compiler)
  - Added ProtocolVisitor.cpp/.h and moved code relating to visiting protocols to there from SemanticVisitor.cpp/.h
