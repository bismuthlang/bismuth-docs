# Introduction
Bismuth is a programming language designed for distributed, concurrent and mobile systems. In other words,
Bismuth is designed for tasks that involve running code on multiple systems, executing code in parallel, or moving
programs between systems. Despite the complex and diverse nature of these tasks, Bismuth strives to provide 
developers with an easy and natural mechanism for communicating these tasks while providing them with 
powerful correctness guarantees that can help them write better and more secure programs.
