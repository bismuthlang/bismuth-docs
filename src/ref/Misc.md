# Misc

This page outlines some of the various statements, expressions, and keywords that have not yet found their way into the other documentation pages. 


## \<type\> (\<identifier 1\>, ..., \<identifier n\> := e)* {.code}
Used to define a variable. For example: 
```bismuth 
int a := 5; 
int b, c := 6; // Both b and c equal 6 (Note: the expression for variables to be assigned to may be re-evalued for each identifier they are bound to. 
int d = 7, e = 8;
```

## var {.code}

The keyword `var` can be used in place of a type name in a variable declaration. Doing so will cause the type to be inferred. 

Example: 
```bismuth 
var a := 5; // a will be inferred as having type int 
var b := false; // b will be inferred as having type bool 
var c := exec Program<P>; // c will be inferred as having type Channel<dual P> 
```

## copy(e : T) : T {.code} 
Given any non-linear expression `e`, `copy` will return a deep copy of the expression. Note: parenthesis around the expression to be copied are optional. 

Example: 
```bismuth 
var a := copy(5); // a will be equal to 5
var b := copy false; // b will be false

var ptr := Box<int>::init(a); 

var c := copy ptr; // c will be a deep copy of ptr
```

## extern \<Identifier\> (T_1, ... T_n) : T_r {.code}

Allows one to import a function from another file/the C standard library whose name is `<Identifier>`, has the return type `T_r`, and has the arguments `T_1, ..., T_n`. This function is likely to be deprecated in favor of an easier system for importing resourcesâ€”including other types (e.g., programs, structs, enums, etc).
